## Ubuntu-Edge-Image

This handy Python script generates an image displaying the percentage of funds raised for the [Ubuntu Edge crowdfunding project](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ubuntu-edge). The entire script is written in Python and requires the following Ubuntu packages:

 - `python-lxml`
 - `python-imaging`

The script is executable and can be run simply with:

    ./update.py

This will generate a file named `percentage.png` in the current directory.
